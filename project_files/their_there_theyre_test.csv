One reason may be that people think of the past and future as guided by different causal forces . In seven studies , the authors demonstrate that people hold asymmetric beliefs about the impact of an individual 's will on past versus future events . People consider the will to be a more potent determinant of future events than events that happened in the past . This asymmetry holds between- and within-subjects , and generalizes beyond undergraduate populations . The authors contend that this asymmetry contributes to the tendency for people to remain confident about their future performance in domains in which they have largely failed in the past . This research thus contributes to a growing body of literature exploring how thoughts about events in the past differ from thoughts about the same events set in",why do people neglect or underweight their past failures when thinking about their prospects of future success,110,17,their,0,0

23779,"It is a well known fact that people should be saving for their future , but somehow life seems to be aways getting in the way . There are today many millions of Americans being exploited both financially and by the system of courts intended to bring justice by following such rules and requlations as prescribed by law . The question of deregulating or regulating is the serious matter facing the people of the United States . Insurance is an insuring or being insured against loss by fire , accidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees the insured that a certain sum will be paid for a specified loss . It is basically a business industry that is bound by a contract ( Policy ) . Insurance in law and economics , is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent loss . It is as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss , from one enity to another , in exchange for a premium insurer , in economic is the company that sells the insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount , called a "" premium "" , to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage . Risk management , the practice of appraising and controlling risk , has evolved as a descrete field of study and practice . The principles of insurance , particularly commerially insurable risk . There have been many complaints about insurance companies not living up to their contract with policies holder , particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Many of these complaints are being denied by the insurance companies because of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floodwaters . This let the insurance companies off the hook completely . These insurance companies want to maximize returns to shareholders , and the common folks are left out in the cold . These insurance companies are simpley robbing people and the authorities who are suppose to regulate them just are n't doing their job that they are were placed there to do . Why are n't the insurance companies regulated ? Insurance Commissioners are appointed and generally come from the insurance industry . This is like the fox in charge of over-seeing the hen house . What other industry generates so much profit , rapes the public , legislates a monopoly and is purported "" regulated at the state level "" . Has anyone ever wondered who lobbied for mandatory auto insurance ? And why do consumers have to pay for their investment losses ? Today the insurance industry is nothing short of a legalized con-game . Some of these politicians of this current U.S. Congress , mostly Republicans say that insurance regulation is not the answer , that insurance companies are in business to make money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is coming in . To these folks I say shame on you for putting profit ahead of life . That is exactly what is wrong with insurance companies , they had rather someone die rather than pay a claim that they are required to pay . These despots insurance companies will lie , cheat , and deny the claim even at the cost of someone 's life if they think the claim will eat into their profit margin , this is so outragous and down right unAmerican . Each state government in the United States has an Insurance Department which independently regulates insurance companies . Most Americans have to resort to the filing of a law suit before the insurance company will even consider paying a legitimate claim , and just one person in these Republican controlled Courts up against a battery of lawyers , experts wittnesses and other liers for hire bought by these mad-dog insurance companies the poor consumer does not stand a chance in hell of getting the due redress required by the claim . Each State Department of Insurance whose responsibility is to regulate insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are financially solvent and stay within the State 's laws and are supposed to protect citizens from bad faith insurers and when insurers break the law they are getting away with it . How are these bad insurance companies getting away with this ? This is done routinely by bad faith insurers claiming to the State Department of Insurance that they are investigating the facts in the matter when in many of the cases they are not . Generally , there is no time limitation attached to the insurers alleged investigation , especially when it comes to matter of fact or factual matters . These bad-faith insurers use tactics of stalling , distorting the truth , use of deception and diversion tactics , and the the one that is their main tactic deny , deny , and deny . In legal terms these actions are collectively referred to as "" Unfair and Deceptive Claim Settlement Practices "" . Some of the things these bad-faith insurers will not tell a potential insurance customer are "" your paying too much "" , "" forget your driving record "" , "" we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketing your deductible "" , "" we can dump you on a whim "" , "" we 'll stiff you if your car is totaled and even if it is n't "" , "" you need a lawyer "" , "" our body shop works for us not you "" , "" we make money by sitting on your claims "" , and lastly "" we own your State Insurance Commission "" . Its just more of the same corporate crime and corruption thats anti-consumer and anti-American . These corrupt insurance companies and the individuals who operate and control them , right along with these corrupt State Insurance Commissioners seem to have no conscience and make excuses and always blames the messegers , and refuse to enforce the breaches of contract . The State Insurance Commissioner once they get into office they are immediately bought off and controlled by the huge amount of money available to the insurance companies . There must be justice served upon these corrupt and criminally wrongful corruption by these Insurance Companies , and the State Commissioners who stand by and do nothing as many Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living the good life . This government is failing miserable in the regulating the insurance industry as well as most all the other industries thoughout the country . A lot of the problems in all the industries of the U.S. is that of deregulation back in the era of Ronald Reagan the Republican Party made as its agenda to deregulate the industries of this country , and since that time things have spiralled out of control .

Both these groups employ certain assumptions and overlook certain details in order to reach their conclusions . As one will observe , proving the efficacy of the statements contained in the Old Testament is not without problems . What at first appears a seemingly harmless task has now thrust itself into the limelight once again and highlights the grave theological problems associated with editorial updating as well as numbers in the Old Testament , and the modern scholars ' ingenious attempts to harmonise them with the archaeological data . There are two models current for dating the Exodus , the early-date model and the late-date model . 9 Both models are based on a considered amount of data both biblical and archaeological . Nevertheless , each model contains a single ' foundational text ' that is a text on which the proponents of each respective model principally ground their entire argument and it is to this we now turn our attention .",there has been a long tradition of resolving the statements made in the old testament with actual archaeological discoveries,124,19,there,1,0

For example , just as we want to allow that our thermometers could be ill-calibrated , and could thus give misleading measurements of temperature , so we want to allow that our ' measurements ' of probabilities via frequencies could be misleading , as when a fair coin lands heads 9 out of 10 times . More than that , it seems to be built into the very notion of probability that such misleading results can arise . Indeed , in many cases , misleading results are guaranteed . Starting with a degenerate case : according to the finite frequentist , a coin that is never tossed , and that thus yields no actual outcomes whatsoever , lacks a probability for heads altogether ; yet a coin that is never measured does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a coin that is tossed exactly once yields a relative frequency of heads of either 0 or 1 , whatever its bias .

Famous enough to merit a name of its own , these are instances of the the so-called ' problem of the single case ' . In fact , many events are most naturally regarded as not merely unrepeated , but in a strong sense unrepeatable -- the 2000 presidential election , the final game of the 2001 NBA play-offs , the Civil War , Kennedy 's assassination , certain events in the very early history of the universe .

"" In 1917 , Russian Formalist scholar Victor Shklovsky coined the term ostranenie to describe the artistic strategy of presenting the well-known as if seen for the first time . The term is translated into German as Verfremdung , which became the cornerstone of Bertolt Brecht 's anti-Aristotelian dramaturgy of estrangement .
